A [DRF](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) -dependent [custom user model](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/) 
based package that offers numerous features from JWT and Basic authentication to REST API end points for signup,signin,
hashed verification-code based account activation and temporary password based password resetting e.t.c.

Most of the package's features are designed to be independently usable and customizable to suit most needs.

## Classes dependency structure

`TokenKey` > `Token` > `User` > `AuthenticationBackend` > `Serializer` > `View` > `url_patterns`
>**NOTE:** the  closer the dependency(use) get to the `url_patterns` the harder it becomes to extend and customize the 
>classes and features before it's predecessor. For example, modifying a `Serializer` without modifying it's dependant 
>`View` and still using unmodified `url_patterns` would most likely result in unexpected behaviour. But on the other 
>hand an extension to the `User` class without a dependency on it's dependant classes(`AuthenticationBackend` e.t.c) 
>will most likely work as expected.

## What makes django-rest-xauth different?

- Custom user class provides most common **optional** fields with reasonable complementary-helper methods e.g. 
`date_of_birth` field that also comes with an age-calculation helper method to help estimate users age
- Access logging(IP-address should be provided as a `X-Forwarded-For` header)
- Failed Sign-in attempts logging(IP-address should be provided as a `X-Forwarded-For` header)
- Password-reset logging(IP-address should be provided as a `X-Forwarded-For` header)
- Encrypted JWT tokens
- Security question based account activation in-case account was deactivated
- Mobile apps friendly:
    - temporary password based user password reset
    - verification code based user account activation.

>**N/B:** _temporary passwords_ and _verification codes_ are both generated and returned from the `User` model hence 
>opting to SMS based sending of the _verification codes_ and _temporary passwords_ should be as easy as extending the 
>`User` model, overriding a single method(that also generates and returns the code) and finally changing django's 
>`AUTH_USER_MODEL` to your model name as [explained here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/customizing/).

## Getting started
Add the following to your Django project's `settings.py` file

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'xauth.User'

INSTALLED_APPS = [
'xauth'
]

XAUTH = {
    # occasionally included in emails sent by the API to your users for familiarity
    'APP_NAME': 'Xently',
    'TOKEN_KEY': force_str(SECRET_KEY),
    'TOKEN_EXPIRY': timedelta(days=60),
    # string. Email addresses to which account / auth-related replies are to be sent.
    # Also permitted: "Name <email-address>"
    'REPLY_TO_ACCOUNTS_EMAIL_ADDRESSES': [
        settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER
    ],
    # string. Email used to send verification code.
    # Also permitted: "Name <email-address>"
    'ACCOUNTS_EMAIL': settings.EMAIL_HOST_USER,
    'ACCOUNTS_EMAIL_PASSWORD': settings.EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD,
    'VERIFICATION_CODE_LENGTH': 6,
    'TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_LENGTH': 8,
    'VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRY': timedelta(hours=1),
    'TEMPORARY_PASSWORD_EXPIRY': timedelta(minutes=30),
    'ACCOUNT_ACTIVATION_TOKEN_EXPIRY': timedelta(days=1),
    # period within which a user is considered new since account creation date
    'NEWBIE_VALIDITY_PERIOD': timedelta(days=1),
    'AUTO_HASH_PASSWORD_ON_SAVE': True,
    'WRAP_DRF_RESPONSE': True,
    'REQUEST_TOKEN_ENCRYPTED': True,
    'POST_REQUEST_USERNAME_FIELD': 'username',
    'POST_REQUEST_PASSWORD_FIELD': 'password',
    'ENFORCE_ACCOUNT_VERIFICATION': True,
    # attempts upon which account is to be deactivated after failed sign-in attempts is reached.
    # 0 or less means no limit
    'MAXIMUM_SIGN_IN_ATTEMPTS': 0,
    'VERIFICATION_ENDPOINT': 'verification-code/verify/',
    'PASSWORD_RESET_ENDPOINT': 'password-reset/verify/',
    'ACTIVATION_ENDPOINT': 'activation/activate/',
    # 0 = both(encrypted&non-encrypted),1 = encrypted only, 2 = non-encrypted only
    'RETURN_TOKEN_TYPE': 0,  
}
